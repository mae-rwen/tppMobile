# Tarot Psychological Portrait

Tarot psychological portrait (TPP for short) is the author's method of working with tarot, created by the well-known and respected Alla Alicja Chrzanowska.

It's used to examine and analyze the innate potentials of a given individual, their talents and predispositions, the influences they were subjected to in childhood and to which they are susceptible in adult life. The best ways to realize emerging opportunities, significant and turning moments in life, as well as those hidden in the subconscious fears, complexes or, as it is called in esoteric language - things to work through. Using the archetypes written in the Major Arcana of the Tarot, substituting the appropriate cards for the numbers resulting from the date of birth allows one to see something like a genetic code with which a person comes into the world.

This method is taught in workshops, and the meaning of each item is explained thoroughly during the course.

The purpose of this application is to calculate individual portraits in an easy and fun way.
